# grove

Grove is a proof-of-concept for subscriptable triples. It might move to subscriptable shapes at some point. For now, triples is good enough, since you can subscribe to a set of them.

## Usage

It is a CRA application, so just `npm install` and `npm run start`, and it will run itself in `localhost:3000`.
