# Naming

What should the app be called?
Keywords:

- Triple
- Ontology
- Gradual
- Semantic
- Presentation
- Visualization
- Display
- Tool
- Gist

Ideas:

- Sempre (SEMantic PREsenter):
  - It's simple and catchy, but could be pronounced SEM PRAY or SEMPER. Maybe that ambiguity is bad.
  - Alternatively:
- Sempr (SEMantic PResenter)
- Tempr (Triples and sEMantic PResenter)
- Stopr (Semantic Technology and Ontology PResenter)
- Stompr (Same as above, but with an m)
- Gravel/Gravl (GRAdual Visualization Environment Layer)
  - Maybe the L can be language, label/labeller, layer
- Gravo (GRAdual Visualization for Ontologies)
- Gravite/Gravitee (Gradual Visualization Interface for commitTEEs)
- Grove (GRadual Ontology Visualization Environment)
- Grapes (GRAdual Presentation Environment for Semantics)
- Spret (Semantic PREsentation Tool)
- Sopret (Semantic Ontologies PREsentation Tool)
- Triplet
- Tovit (Triples and Ontology VIsualization Tool)
- Sovit (Semantic Ontology VIsualization Tool)
  - Maybe a little TOO close to Soviet
- Sorrel (Semantic Ontologies for Review and Reveal)
- Tograp (Triples and Ontology GRAdual Presenter)
